In this collection of research projects, we take a layered approach to foundational verification
of correctness and accuracy of numerical software--that is,
formal machine-checked proofs about programs (not just algorithms),
with no assumptions except specifications of instruction-set
architectures.  We build, improve, and use appropriate tools at
each layer: proving in the real numbers about discrete
algorithms; proving how floating-point algorithms approximate
real-number algorithms; reasoning about C program implementation
of floating-point algorithms; and connecting all proofs end-to-end
in Coq.

Our initial research projects (and results) are,
- [cbench_vst](https://github.com/cverified/cbench-vst)/sqrt: Square root by Newton's Method, by [Appel and Bertot](https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.1972-5787/11442).
- [VerifiedLeapfrog](https://github.com/VeriNum/VerifiedLeapfrog): A verified numerical method for an Ordinary Differential Equation, by [Kellison and Appel](https://github.com/VeriNum/VerifiedLeapfrog/raw/main/Paper.pdf).
- [VCFloat2](vcfloat): Floating-point error analysis in Coq, by Appel & Kellison, improvements on an earlier open-source project by Ramananandro et al.
- [Parallel Dot Product](https://github.com/VeriNum/pardotprod), demonstrating how to use VST to verify correctness of simple shared-memory task parallelism
- [Stationary Iterative Methods](https://github.com/VeriNum/iterative_methods) with formally verified error bounds
- [Finite Element Method](https://bindel-group.github.io/simple_cfem/) verification (in progress)
